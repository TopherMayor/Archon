# Agent Name Tracking

This document outlines how Archon tracks the specific AI agent responsible for task creation and modification.

## `agent_name` Field

The `tasks` table in the database now includes an `agent_name` column. This field stores the human-readable name of the client agent that created or last updated a task.

## Client Identification

Clients, such as IDE extensions, should identify themselves by including a custom `X-Agent-Name` HTTP header in their Socket.IO connection request.

### Example Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcp_connection": {
    "url": "ws://localhost:8051",
    "options": {
      "transportOptions": {
        "polling": {
          "extraHeaders": {
            "X-Agent-Name": "gemini-air-instance-1"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Server-Side Handling

The MCP server reads the `X-Agent-Name` header upon connection and associates the name with the client's Socket.IO session ID (`sid`). When a task is created or updated, this name is automatically saved to the `agent_name` field in the database.

If a client connects without the header, it will be logged as `"Unnamed Agent"`.
